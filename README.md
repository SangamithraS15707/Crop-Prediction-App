# Crop Prediction App

This is a Streamlit application that predicts suitable crops based on soil and environmental parameters.

## Features

- Input parameters for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH value, and rainfall.
- Predicts the recommended crop based on the input parameters using a trained machine learning model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13
- Streamlit
- Joblib
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\CROP_RECOMMENDER 
3. Install the required packages  

pip install streamlit joblib numpy pillow scikit-learn

Usage
